This is day one of my Google Homepage Clone. 

I will try many things to replicate the real Google Page and with a little luck and hard work, I will
accomplish the task.


Tools I will be using:

1. Odin Project website for reference
2. VSCode (text editor)
3. Google ...of course for more reference!!!

How did I accomplish the clone?

To be determined...(Will update soon.)
